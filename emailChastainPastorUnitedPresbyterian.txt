Please, forward to Chastain, Pastor.


Hi Chastain,


Thanks, for sparing some time and allowing me to offer my services as
a Pastor in residence. Like, I mentioned in our conversation I am
open and willing to fill in the gaps in church services and serve both
the lord and the lay. I am convinced that the lord and lay are both
better served, by the church offering daily prayer services and other
necessary just services as, pantry and supplies to keep the christian
spirit and expand the love of the lord to ourselves and the lay.


Please, pray to the lord and share my prayers with other church
leaders, elders and lay. I give myself to the lord.


Thank you,
Rakesh.
