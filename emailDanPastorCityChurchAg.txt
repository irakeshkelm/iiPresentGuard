Thanks,


for the groceries. Just so you know, some of them were spoiled
(beyond expiry date and beyond edible).


Please, pass my request to meet with the Pastor (thanks for sharing
that you have a Lead pastor - Joe). As, I mentioned, the context
would be to offer my services as Pastor in residence, to both the lord
and the lay.


Thanks again,
Rakesh.
